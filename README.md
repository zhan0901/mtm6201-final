# Ning's Photography Portfolio Website

A responsive photography portfolio website built with Bootstrap 5, showcasing photography works and services.

## Development Process

### Planning and Design
- Started with creating wireframes and mockups for mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
- Focused on user experience and responsive design principles
- Planned the content structure and navigation flow

### Implementation
- Built the website using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5
- Implemented responsive images using the `<picture>` element
- Created a consistent design language across all pages
- Ensured accessibility compliance with ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Responsive Image Management
- **Problem**: Needed to serve different image sizes for different devices while maintaining quality
- **Solution**: Implemented `<picture>` element with multiple `<source>` tags and used media queries to serve appropriate image sizes

### Challenge 2: Navigation Bar Responsiveness
- **Problem**: Navigation menu needed different layouts for mobile and desktop views
- **Solution**: Utilized Bootstrap's navbar component and customized it with CSS for smooth transitions

### Challenge 3: Contact Form Layout

- **Solution**: Implemented Bootstrap's grid system and form components with custom CSS for better visual hierarchy
